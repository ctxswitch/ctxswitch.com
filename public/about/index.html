<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Rob.  The fact that you are here leads me to think that you are either entirely bored or have a propensity to read everything that you see on the internet.  On the off chance, that you genuinely want to know about me, here are a few tidbits.  Just remember, you asked for it.</p>

<h2 id="techobabble-what-i-do-for-a-living">Techobabble (What I do for a living)</h2>

<p>From a career standpoint, I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time in High-Performance Computing research groups focused primarily on bioinformatics and physics.  In 2015, I entered the private sector and am now deep in infrastructure and reliability for one of the largest mobile analytics companies that you probably have not heard of - but you probably use our customer&rsquo;s apps and services.  My experience spans working directly on metal and in the cloud with all of the nuances that each environment brings to the table.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I&rsquo;ve wound up in leadership positions in most of my jobs.  It&rsquo;s good or bad depending on how you look at it.  Since the critical path of my career tends is focused on teams rather than hands-on at this point, I tend to spend most of my free time in the futile struggle of keeping my skills from deteriorating too much.</p>

<p>Even though my career path has masochistically (or sadistically - depending on which side you are on) focused on the infrastructure engineering side of technology, my true love is still software.  I don&rsquo;t get into those areas as much as I used to, but in my day I was an avid Ruby and Python programmer.  These days, I&rsquo;ve been focusing more on Rust and Go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on projects that span the entire stack: From front-end development, backend service development, systems programming, and data center design/buildouts.</p>

<h2 id="deeper-down-the-rabbit-hole-what-i-care-about">Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole (What I care about)</h2>

<p>On a more personal note, I have a fantastic family and a genuinely patient partner who tolerates an overdeveloped sense of commitment to technology and work. Why she hasn&rsquo;t left me yet will forever remain a mystery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much a lover of art, music, and animals (all animals, but I have to say that I gravitate to cats).  One of my favorite dates with my wife involved hopping on a plane, flying to Boston, and visiting the Museum of Fine Arts.  When I was younger, I thought I was going to be an artist but found out that it was more of a hobby than something I wanted to do full time.  While inevitably debugging system and application issues at 3:00 AM, I often ponder whether or not I should have taken that road.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom whose in-theater experiences fostered a deep-seated belief in individual and human rights - not just for humans that look and act like a select few (i.e., white and orange men - ok, that was political).  Surprisingly enough, though you may hear the &lsquo;no atheists in foxholes&rsquo; mantra from time to time, Iraq killed my belief in religion and the notion of a higher power.</p>

<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve tried to pull out the weeds of intolerance and hate that came from the ultra-conservative and ultra-religious environment that growing up in a small town in Idaho brought with it.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I am militant in any of my liberal leaning views.  I think that everyone is entitled to their opinions as long as they don&rsquo;t try to force those views on others or restrict the actions of others based on a hyper-developed sense of morality and righteous indignation.</p>

<p>Well, that got pretty personal fast, and it&rsquo;s probably more than you wanted to know about me, but I like to be open about my beliefs, non-beliefs, and values.  I have a lot to learn and am thankful to the people that have called me out when I&rsquo;ve stumbled across shitty thought patterns.  I&rsquo;m on a mission of constant improvement and change.</p>

<p>If I were to summarize who I am in a sentence it would probably be (in the 3rd person of course): Rob is a slightly neurotic and irreverent person who is deeply empathetic towards all things living.  Yeah, that pretty much says it.</p>
