As part of either an apparent midlife crisis or just a fit of boredom, I've retired my former website rlyon.me.  Most of the content that was previously there has not been moved over.  There was not that much there and let's be honest - it was old enough or shitty enough that it was not relevant at this point.  SO... if you've made it here from a Google link and were expecting to find something, sorry :)

My previous site was hosted with Github pages using Jekyll as the static content generator and it was good, but it was always a little wonky for me and as a result of the strange workflow and a bit of laziness on my part, I didn't update it much.   If you aren't here for the kinder, gentler 404 and are actually reading this after having come directly to this site, I have much more hope for this new website.

I'm now hosting on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - which is an absolutely amazing hosting service - kudos to the development and infra teams that make that available to us every day.  I've also moved away from Jeykll and started using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is much more intuitive and fits into a more coherent workflow.  I do have to call out [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) as well.  I love to write, but I hate the time that it takes to proof content before I send it out.   Grammarly cuts down that time significantly.  With these new tools, my website fits into workflows that I'm extremely comfortable with and now that fighting with my tools is a thing of the past if I can get through the touch of laziness (well, not laziness - exhaustion) - I'll have some good content in store.

As I'm diving deep into a project I'm generally more productive and will retain the information if I'm writing down what I'm doing.  Lately, my work is centering around containers (Docker), container deployment strategies, configuration management (Chef), Kubernetes, and distributed database strategies.  I currently have several posts in process and will be adding an in-depth look at container images on Thursday.  Followups will look at container isolation, considerations for using chef in a large elastic environment, and a look at Vitess which appears to be a generally viable (as opposed to environmentally constrained) distributed database technology created by YouTube and open sourced.

If you have a burning desire to access the information that cannot be quelled by this message, you can contact me via social media (links are above) and I'd be happy to share the markdown and images used to generate the retired pages.

Thanks for stopping by.
