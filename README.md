On the off chance you are actually curious about the source, dive on in.

## Developing and Contributing

Though I will not accept PRs for new content, feel free to send PRs to fix gramatical or factual issues, or provide clarity around specific subjects.  I'll add you as a contributor to the page and you'll be forever immortalized on a shitty website that nobody probably uses. :)
